JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the front-end and back-end of web development. It is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is often just-in-time compiled. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

JavaScript is used to add interactivity to web pages, such as creating drop-down menus, animations, and dynamic content. It is also used to develop web applications, such as online stores and social media platforms.
